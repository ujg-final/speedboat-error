**About**

The Electric Motor Control reference application by Speedgoat, is aiming to provide you with a starting point to electric motor controls development using Model-Based Design. The reference application is packed with a set of exercises that show you how to best combine the power of Speedgoat real-time solutions with Simulink, Simscape Electrical and Motor Control Blockset, among other MathWorks products, for motor control design and testing. Download the reference application and discover the process of developing a digital controller based on field-oriented control (FOC) algorithm, from the initial design stages, to prototyping and final deployment and testing.  

The reference application leverages the Speedgoat [HIL Demo Ki](https://www.speedgoat.com/products-services/demo-kits/hil-with-ti-microcontroller)t  and the [Electric Motor Control Kit](https://www.speedgoat.com/products-services/demo-kits/pmsm-motor-control). The latter features a small 100W Maxon PMSM motor with integrated Hall Sensor and Encoder, and the Speedgoat 1.4 kW [Three-phase Inverter](https://www.speedgoat.com/products/pwr-tpi6020)  that supports switching frequencies up to 50kHz. These kits seamless operate with the cost-effective IO397 FGPA I/O Module, which supports PWM [generation](https://www.speedgoat.com/products/simulink-programmable-fpgas-fpga-code-module-pwm-generation) and [capture](https://www.speedgoat.com/products/simulink-programmable-fpgas-fpga-code-module-pwm-capture), with time resolution as low as 5ns, as well quadrature [encoding](https://www.speedgoat.com/products/simulink-programmable-fpgas-fpga-code-module-quadrature-encoder) and [decoding](https://www.speedgoat.com/products/simulink-programmable-fpgas-fpga-code-module-quadrature-decoder).

**Learn how to:**

 - Create accurate brushless DC motor models and fine-tune controller gains by collecting data directly from the hardware
 - Prototype your controller on [Speedgoat target hardware](https://www.speedgoat.com/products-services/real-time-target-machines) and quickly spin a brushless DC motor using Simulink Real-Time and the Speedgoat [Electric Motor Control Kit](https://www.speedgoat.com/products-services/demo-kits/electric-motor-control)
 - Monitor and control your real-time application directly from Simulink models or with instrument panel apps 
 - Automatically run test-cases and prove that your embedded motor controller meets requirements with Hardware-in-the-Loop testing
 - Configure your prototype controller model to generate compact and fast C code for any target microcontroller
